# How to setup project
1. Add System Variable "CINDER_DIR" and link it to cinder folder
eg. C:\Users\santa\Desktop\Cinder\cinder_0.8.6_vc2013

2. Download OpenCV 2.4.9 from website and extract to somewhere ex C:/
download link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.4.9/opencv-2.4.9.exe/download

2.1 Then add System Variable "OPENCV249_LIB" and link it to opencv vc12 x86 staticlib folder
eg. C:\opencv\build\x86\vc12\staticlib

3. Open CVProject.sln and click CANCEL if it says to update compiler (we will use vc++12 only)
